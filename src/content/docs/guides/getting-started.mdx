# Welcome to Doras! ðŸš€
Doras is a fully featured platform to help creators share their presence online. With tools such as our Link in Bio, link shortening, and more, we help creators share their content with their audience. Let's get you started!

### Creating an Account
On Doras, it's really simple to get started. First, head over to the [sign up page here](https://admin.doras.to/signup). You'll be greeted with a form that looks like this (please note that this picture is from pre-release and may look slightly different):

[![Sign Up Form](https://gezel.b-cdn.net/doras/docs/Screenshot%202023-11-07%20at%2020.26.59.png)](https://admin.doras.to/auth)

You can choose to sign up via SSO such as Discord, Twitch or X.com, or you can manually create an account with the form. 

:::tip[Don't worry!]
If you signed up via SSO, you will be prompted to choose your username after you create your account, and can change to a email/password at any time.

Once you're signed in, don't forget to check your email. You should have an email from `hi@mail.doras.to` to verify your email address. If you don't see it, check your spam folder. If you're certain it's not there, please drop us a message on [Discord](https://gezel.io/discord) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/doras-to/doras/issues) and we'll help you out, just let us know your username!
