# Welcome to Doras! ðŸš€
Doras is a fully featured platform to help creators share their presence online. With tools such as our Link in Bio, link shortening, and more, we help creators share their content with their audience. Let's get you started!

### Creating an Account
On Doras, it's really simple to get started. First, head over to the [sign up page here](https://admin.doras.to/signup). You'll be greeted with a form that looks like this (please note that this picture is from pre-release and may look slightly different):

[![Sign Up Form](https://gezel.b-cdn.net/doras/docs/Screenshot%202023-11-07%20at%2020.26.59.png)](https://admin.doras.to/auth)

You can choose to sign up via SSO such as Discord, Twitch or X.com, or you can manually create an account with the form. 

:::tip[Don't worry!]
If you signed up via SSO, you will be prompted to choose your username after you create your account, and can change to a email/password at any time.

### Setting up your Account

After creating your new account and verifying your email address, youâ€™ll now have access to Doras.to! Weâ€™ll walk you through the next steps in the Welcome Guide.

![Creating Username](https://gezel.b-cdn.net/doras-docs/Screenshot%202023-12-06%20132453.png)

Enter in your username and a small bio about yourself. The username will be whatâ€™s used in your account slug, for example: https://doras.to/lady-d-22. `lady-d-22` is my username. This is also where you can upload a profile picture for your Doras account.

In the next page, youâ€™ll add in your first link.
