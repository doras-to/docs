GitHub can be daunting to use at first, but it's a great way to get involved with the Doras community. If you've found a bug or want to suggest a new feature, you can create an issue on GitHub.

## Creating an issue

1. Go to the [Doras repository](https://github.com/doras-to/doras/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and check all the open issues to see if your issue has already been reported first.

:::tip
If an issue is already open or is similar, you can add a comment to the existing issue with anything additional you have found, or provide some insights. You can also follow this issue by clicking the `Subscribe` button at the bottom of the issue to stay up to date when it's fixed!

2. If you can't find an existing issue, click the `New issue` button at the top right of the page. From here you can see some different categories of issues, such as bug reports, feature requests, and feedback. Choose the one that best fits your issue.

3. **Fill out what's relevant**. If you're reporting a bug, make sure to include the steps to reproduce the bug, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened. If you're suggesting a new feature, make sure to include a description of the feature and why you think it would be useful.

4. **Add a descriptive title**. This helps others find your issue, and makes it easier to reference in the future.

5. Yeet the issue over to us, and you're done! We'll take a look at it as soon as we can, and follow up with any questions or updates.
