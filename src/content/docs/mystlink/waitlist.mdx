# Joining the Waitlist
We ask all [Mystl.ink](https://mystl.ink) users to join the waitlist for [Doras.to](https://doras.to) as we're going to be migrating all users over to the new service. This is to ensure that we can provide the best possible experience for all users. Joining the waitlist means you can get in on the action earlier, and you'll be able to use the service before anyone else. Any users who don't join the waitlist will eventually be manually migrated over, but accounts won't become activated until first sign in.


## Understanding the differences
[Mystl.ink](https://mystl.ink) and [Doras.to](https://doras.to) may provide the same features and services (at root level), but please know that they are completely different services, and with that, we're going to attempt a migration to help existing users get brought up to speed.

## What's included in the migration?
#### Usernames
Usernames will be migrated over, no questions asked. If you were "mystl.ink/username", you'll be "doras.to/username". This is to ensure that you don't lose your username, and you can continue to use the service as you did before.
:::tip[Regarding the username.mystl.ink subdomains]
We won't be reintroducing subdomains to Doras, so your only URL will be `doras.to/username`. This is to ensure that we can provide the best possible service to all users. Your existing `username.mystl.ink` subdomain will continue to redirect to your new Doras URL however once you've been accepted into the waitlist.
:::

#### Links
Any links you had on Mystl.ink will be migrated over to Doras.to. This will only include the link title and destination, it doesn't include any styling or icon you may have set on the button. This is because we're using a completely different system to generate the links, and we're using a different icon provider. You'll be able to set your own icon and button styling once you've been accepted into the waitlist.

## What's not included?
- Previous analytic data
- Profile pictures
- Button styling
- Twitter feed
- Any embeds such as Twitch, YouTube, KoFi, etc.

## What's new?
A hell of a lot. We've completely rewritten from the ground up using next level technologies and impecible UI frameworks. If you want to know the tech jargon, I'll add that soon. But for now, just know that we've completely rewritten the service to provide a better experience for all users.

### Link In Bio
We've designed this to be as simple but streamline as possible, with some long awaited prebuilt templates to help style your page. Some of ya'll made some horrible looking pages that could come close to a warcrime against design, and we wanted to solve that once and for all.

### Your Story
Your Story is a new feature to Doras. It's basically a fully formattable single blog post that you can write anything in, tell your users about yourself, or anything else! It's a great way to get your users to know you better, and it's a great way to get your users to engage with you.

### Link Shortening
We're going to be launching a new service that'll help you shorten any link to help with your brand consistency. For example, if you want `somelongurl.com/this-is-a-really-long-url` to be shortened to `username.doras.click/short`, you'll be able to do that. 

### Brand Accounts
Previously if you wanted to share an account with multiple users, you had to set up a whole new account and add people as managers to help manage it. This isn't the case anymore. Users can now make "Brand Accounts" and give access to other users without having to worry about logging out/in and dealing with some clunky UI elements.

### Custom Domains
We're going to be launching a new service that'll help you set up a custom domain for your page. This means you can have `yourdomain.com` redirect to your Link In Bio page. This is a great way to help with your brand consistency, and it's a great way to help your users remember your page. You'll be able to use it for your main profile, as well as for the Link Shortening service mentioned previously.

### Analytics
We've completely rebuilt the analytics section. It comes with some beautiful and easy to understand graphs, as well as more in depth about where traffic is coming from, etc. We've also added a new feature that'll help you track your Link In Bio page, so you can see how many people are visiting your page, and how many people are clicking on your links.

There's more to come, and many plans built around everything that this post can't really get into, but we'll talk about it more when the time comes. For now, enroll in the [Doras.to](https://doras.to) waitlist, and we'll see you soon!
